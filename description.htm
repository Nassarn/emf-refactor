	<b>EMF Refactor</b> is an Eclipse open source tool environment conveniently supporting a <b>structured model quality assurance process</b>. 
	In particular, EMF Refactor supports metrics reporting, smell detection, and refactoring for models being based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework, 
	a widely used open source technology in model-based software development. 
	</p>
	<p>
	The following major functionalities are provided:
	<ul>
		<li>User-friendly support for project-specific configurations of model metrics, smells, and refactorings.
		<li>Calculation of model metrics, detection of model smells, and application of model refactorings.
		<li>Generation of model metrics and smell detection reports.
		<li>Suggestion of suitable refactorings in case of specific smell occurrences.
		<li>Provision of suitable information in cases where new model smells come in by applying a certain refactoring.
		<li>Support for the implementation of new model metrics, smells, and refactorings.
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>	
	The tool environment mainly consists of two kinds of modules: 
	For calculating model metrics, detecting smells, and executing refactorings there is an <b>application module</b> each. 
	Similarly there are three <b>specification modules</b> for generating metrics, smell, and refactoring plugins containing Java code that can be used by the corresponding application module.
